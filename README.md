### 1. Play videos instead of previews

### 2. Replace Thumbnails With High-Res Images

Replaces thumbnails with original high res images in Galleries, Images and Performer tab.

You can see the difference in sharpness, details and colors.

<table>
  <tr align="center">
    <td>Default Thumbnail</td>
     <td>Replaced Image by the plugin</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./assets/replace-thumbnails-with-images/thumbnail.jpeg" style="width: 427px; height: 640px;"></td>
